A sonar-like tracking system for players within a VRChat World.
This is much like a **Framework** in that more plug-ins and add-ons will be made and added over time.
### Why make a new tracker and not use an existing one?
Originally, We used an existing `Collider` and `Event` based tracking solution. However, this was prone to failure in many regards primarily because it was unreliable and would make many tracking mistakes when it came to certain events or edge cases, using colliders was a bit of a pain for Raycast guns at times. So we decided it was better to design this system that uses `Transforms` as probes that check the closest probe to each player and assign them to the room of that probe.

# Setting up the Prefab
By default, you will have a Prefab folder with a prefab for one fully set-up room and two displays.
- Drag the `Location Tracker [Core]` Prefab into the scene.
- Within the GameObject called "Rooms" will be a GameObject Called "Room 1" Drag this to the location of your first room to set up.
- Select the `Location Tracker [Core]` GameObject from here you can Manage, Add, or Delete rooms.
- Give your first room a name in the "Room List" This will mirror the room name to the `TrackerRoom(Script)` and apply it to the "roomName" Variable as well as the GameObject of the room's script.
- From here you can use the foldout called "Probes" from here you can add or delete probes in a room.
- Next just simply adjust the positions of the probes throughout your room. (Keep them low to the floor for best results)
- Once you have that configured you can add rooms and probes via the `Location Tracker [Core]` Script and use the Prefabs in the folder located at `PlayertrackerV2/Prefabs/Components` to supply them.
- Set up any `Plugins` you want to use currently we only supply the two displays.
- Lastly, set up how you want to make the tracker refresh built-in is "PingLoop" which you can set in `Seconds` of how often you want it to run.
- Alternatively, you can set "PingLoop" to `0` which will disable it, and use a function call to script your own "Ping" scripts using the `Functions` below.

| More Plug-ins Soon!  | This is a project that will be added to as we at [Lastation](https://discord.gg/lastation) need them. However, we are going to provide documentation below so you can make your own, and should you want them added to `main` just contact us or create a [issue](https://github.com/LastationVRChat/Lastation-Player-Tracker/issues)                                                                                                                                                                                        |
